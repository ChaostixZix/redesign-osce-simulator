### Available NPM Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reloading
- `npm run build` - Build production-ready application
- `npm start` - Start production server
- `npm run check` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run db:push` - Push database schema changes

### Environment Configuration

The application requires several environment variables for full functionality:

```env
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/osce_simulator

# AI Integration
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key

# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# Session Management (optional)
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret-key
```

### Development Tips

1. **Database Setup**: Use Neon serverless PostgreSQL for easy cloud database setup
2. **API Testing**: The server runs on `http://localhost:5000` with API endpoints at `/api/*`
3. **Hot Reloading**: Vite provides instant frontend updates; server restarts automatically on backend changes
4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript is configured for strict checking across the entire stack
5. **Database Changes**: Use `npm run db:push` to sync schema changes with your database

### Code Style and Standards

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled for enhanced type safety
- **ESLint**: Configured for React and TypeScript best practices
- **Prettier**: Automatic code formatting on save
- **Components**: Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- **State Management**: Prefer TanStack Query for server state, useState for local state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS utility classes with shadcn/ui component patterns

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check if DATABASE_URL is correctly set
echo $DATABASE_URL

# Test database connection
npm run db:push
```

#### OpenAI API Issues
- Ensure your OpenAI API key has sufficient credits
- Check that the API key is correctly set in your `.env` file
- Verify your OpenAI account has access to the required models (GPT-3.5 or GPT-4)

#### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Find process using port 5000
lsof -i :5000

# Kill the process (replace PID with actual process ID)
kill -9 <PID>
```

#### TypeScript Compilation Errors
```bash
# Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Run type checking
npm run check
```

#### Build Issues
```bash
# Clear build cache
rm -rf dist/
rm -rf client/dist/

# Rebuild from scratch
npm run build
```

### Performance Optimization

- **Database**: Use connection pooling for production deployments
- **Caching**: TanStack Query provides intelligent caching for API responses
- **Bundle Size**: Vite automatically optimizes and splits bundles for faster loading
- **AI Responses**: Consider implementing response caching for frequently asked questions

## üéØ Use Cases

### For Medical Students
- Practice clinical skills in a safe, simulated environment
- Prepare for actual OSCE examinations
- Learn systematic approaches to patient assessment
- Build confidence in patient interactions

### For Medical Educators
- Create standardized clinical cases
- Assess student performance objectively
- Provide consistent training experiences
- Track student progress over time

### For Healthcare Professionals
- Continuing medical education

- Maintain clinical competencies

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- **Performance Analytics**: Detailed scoring algorithms and performance metrics
- **Case Library Management**: Administrative interface for creating and managing cases
- **Session Recording**: Playback functionality for review and assessment
- **Multi-user Support**: Collaborative scenarios and peer assessments
- **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design for tablet and mobile devices
- **Integration Capabilities**: LMS integration and gradebook synchronization

## üîê Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with configurable timeouts
- **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed using industry-standard algorithms
- **API Protection**: All endpoints require proper authentication except public routes
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured cross-origin resource sharing

### Data Protection
- **Patient Data**: All simulated patient data is fictional and HIPAA-compliant
- **Database Security**: PostgreSQL with encrypted connections and access controls
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration stored in environment variables
- **API Keys**: OpenAI API keys are securely managed and not exposed to client-side

### Best Practices
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated using Zod schemas
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Drizzle ORM provides built-in protection
- **XSS Protection**: React's built-in XSS protection and content sanitization
- **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for production deployments

## üöÄ Deployment

### Production Deployment Options

#### Option 1: Traditional VPS/Cloud Server
```bash
# 1. Clone repository on server
git clone https://github.com/ChaostixZix/redesign-osce-simulator.git
cd redesign-osce-simulator

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Set production environment variables
export NODE_ENV=production
export DATABASE_URL=your_production_database_url
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key

# 4. Run database migrations
npm run db:push

# 5. Build and start
npm run build
npm start
```

#### Option 2: Docker Deployment
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .
RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

#### Option 3: Serverless Deployment (Vercel/Netlify)
- Frontend can be deployed to Vercel/Netlify
- Backend requires Node.js runtime (Vercel Functions or similar)
- Database: Use Neon, Supabase, or other serverless PostgreSQL

### Environment Configuration for Production

```env
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://prod_user:password@prod_host:5432/osce_db
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-production-key
PORT=5000
SESSION_SECRET=production-session-secret-256-chars
```

### Performance Recommendations

- **Database**: Use connection pooling (pg-pool) for high concurrency
- **Caching**: Implement Redis for session storage and API response caching
- **CDN**: Use CDN for static assets and images
- **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring (Winston, DataDog, etc.)
- **Load Balancing**: Use nginx or cloud load balancers for multiple instances

### Scaling Considerations

- **Database Scaling**: PostgreSQL read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- **API Scaling**: Horizontal scaling with multiple server instances
- **AI Rate Limits**: Implement queuing for OpenAI API calls during high usage
- **Session Storage**: Move from in-memory to Redis/database for multi-instance deployments

## üß™ Testing

### Current Testing Approach
The project currently focuses on TypeScript compilation checking and runtime validation:

- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage across frontend and backend
- **Schema Validation**: Zod schemas ensure data integrity at runtime
- **Manual Testing**: UI testing through browser interaction and API testing via development server

### Recommended Testing Additions
```bash
# Unit Testing Setup (Jest + React Testing Library)
npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom

# API Testing (Supertest)
npm install --save-dev supertest @types/supertest

# E2E Testing (Playwright or Cypress)
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
```

### Testing Medical Scenarios
- **Case Validation**: Verify medical cases follow clinical protocols
- **AI Response Testing**: Ensure AI patient responses are medically appropriate
- **User Journey Testing**: Complete OSCE workflow testing
