*OSCE Simulator - Medical Training Platform*

</div>

## üè• What is this app?

The **Medical OSCE Simulator** is a comprehensive web-based training platform designed for medical students and healthcare professionals to practice their clinical skills through interactive, AI-powered patient simulations. OSCE stands for "Objective Structured Clinical Examination" - a standardized method of assessing clinical competence.

## üåü Key Features

### üìö **Structured Clinical Cases**
- Pre-built medical cases with realistic patient scenarios
- Each case includes patient demographics, chief complaints, and clinical context
- Timed sessions (typically 30 minutes) to simulate real OSCE conditions
- Multiple differential diagnoses and available diagnostic tests

### ü§ñ **AI-Powered Patient Interactions**
- Interactive chat with AI patients powered by OpenAI
- Natural language conversations for history taking
- Realistic patient responses based on medical context
- Quick question templates for common inquiries

### üîç **Interactive Physical Examination**
- Visual body examination interface
- Virtual medical tools (stethoscope, ophthalmoscope, otoscope, reflex hammer)
- Click-to-examine different body regions (head & neck, chest, abdomen, extremities)
- Real-time recording of examination findings

### üß™ **Diagnostic Testing Workflow**
- Order laboratory tests and imaging studies
- Comprehensive test categories: Hematology, Chemistry, Cardiac Markers, Imaging, Specialized
- Realistic test results based on the clinical scenario
- Timed test processing (results available after realistic delays)
- Common tests include CBC, PT/INR, D-Dimer, Troponins, X-rays, CT scans, and more

*Comprehensive test ordering interface with categorized medical tests*

### üìä **Comprehensive Assessment Stages**
The platform guides students through the complete OSCE workflow:

1. **History Taking** - Interview the AI patient
2. **Physical Examination** - Conduct systematic examination
3. **Laboratory Tests** - Order and interpret lab results
4. **Imaging Studies** - Request and review imaging
5. **Diagnosis** - Formulate differential diagnoses
6. **Treatment Plan** - Develop management strategies

### üìà **Progress Tracking**
- Real-time session timer
- Stage-by-stage progress indicators
- Session save and pause functionality
- Performance scoring and feedback

## üñ•Ô∏è User Interface
